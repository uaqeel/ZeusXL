# ZeusXL
Zeus add-in for Excel

An addin I wrote (and re-wrote and re-wrote and re-wrote) starting 2010. Zeus has, over time, been a backtesting engine, a HFT engine and a powerful utilities library.

In its current incarnation, it is an addin that retrieves/manipulates Bloomberg data through an embedded R interpreter. This R functionality is modelled after ContraModus, a web-based analytics tool created by my former colleague Vladimir Vladimirov. The R functionality not allows basic data manipulation but sophisticated backtests incorporating vol-targetting, dynamic positioning and much more.
